- # Examples
	- #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	  This is an example.
	  
	  It allows you to write longer pieces of text and use ENTER to create new lines while staying in the same block.
	  Depending on the theme, this text will be inside a differently colored box.
	  
	  Formatting codes (such as *italic* or **bold**) won't be interpreted, instead all characters will be shown as entered.
	  #+END_EXAMPLE
- # Verses
	- #+BEGIN_VERSE
	  this is a verse
	  it allows us to write longer pieces of texts
	  
	  and using `ENTER` while staying in the same block.
	  
	  You could use `CTRL` + `ENTER` to make new lines within the same block, but for longer texts, creating a **verse**-block would reduce the friction of just writing your text.
	  
	  One difference from using **EXAMPLE** is that the text will be shown as a non-special block.
	  #+END_VERSE
- # Centered text
	- #+BEGIN_CENTER
	  this text is centered.
	  In other words, IN THE MIDDLE!
	  #+END_CENTER
